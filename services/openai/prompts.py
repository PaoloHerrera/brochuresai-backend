Keep it confident, not pushy; avoid hard-sell language.\n"

Prefer a light theme with a subtle tinted background (e.g., #f7f9fc) and one accent color with accessible contrast.

Use section, .card, h2, h3 { break-inside: avoid } only for small blocks; allow long sections to break naturally across pages to prevent truncation.\n- Provide helper .page-break { break-after: page } if you need a manual break.\n- Ensure anchors are visible and legible when printed (underline, accessible color).\n"
